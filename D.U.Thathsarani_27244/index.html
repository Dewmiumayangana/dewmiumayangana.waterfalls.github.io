<p class="card-text text-left text-capitalize"><em><strong>The Asia Waterfalls page is where we showcase the waterfalls that we’ve visited across the Pacific Ocean. While Asia represents the continent where we have our ancestral roots, it still remains somewhat of a far-flung part of the globe.
	          
	          Growing up, we’ve only had glimpses of what’s there revealed to us by our parents and relatives. So we ended up thinking about the Asian continent as both strangely familiar yet strikingly unfamiliar.
	          
	          For the purposes of this site, the countries belonging to this Asia Waterfalls page come from as far west as India, the westernmost extremes of China, and even Siberian Russia (up to the Ural Mountains). We also include countries that go as far south as Indonesia and as far east as Japan.
	          
	          In general, these countries are all north of the equator (though Indonesia and Malaysia straddles the line) and west of the international date line, which means the islands of the Philippines and Melanesia are included in this region (even though you could argue that they belong in the Oceania Region).
	          
	          You could also argue that the line of separation between Asia and Oceania is not really well-defined so I’m just going by the easiest geographical divisions and less on political boundaries, which can easily change.
	          
	          Nevertheless, Asia is vast and includes many countries and nationalities. While we still managed to attain a humble sampling of waterfalls here, we’ll remain opportunistic about any new chances to add to our waterfall sightings collection…</strong></em></p>

	      <h5 class="card-title">Waterfalls of Australia</h5>
	      <p class="card-text text-capitalize text-left"><em><strong>We found it particularly challenging to limit our extensive survey of Australian Waterfalls down to just ten. Heck, we even had to leave out waterfalls such as Dip Falls, Wangi Falls, Fortescue Falls, Liffey Falls, Florence Falls, Wentworth Falls, and so many others!
	        
	        That should tell you how competitive and exclusive this list is!
	        
	        Moreover, just to give you an idea of how expansive our survey is, you can see the waterfall map or the comprehensive listing in our page dedicated to all the Australian Waterfalls that we’ve been to and written about.
	        
	        Indeed, Oz possessed too many beautiful waterfalls. Thus, we inevitably had to make some very tough choices and snub some very deserving ones.
	        
	        So without further ado, here they are in reverse order…</strong></em></p>

	      <h5 class="card-title">Waterfalls of Europe</h5>
	      <p class="card-text text-left text-capitalize"><strong><em>In any case, Julie and I finally got to a point where we could credibly put together such a list for Europe. After all, our waterfall survey of this diverse continent has now covered Austria, Germany, Iceland, Norway, Great Britain, Switzerland, France, Italy, Croatia, Spain, Luxembourg, and Greece.
	        
	        We ultimately decided to make this list non-discriminatory and cover all of Europe. We had contemplated leaving off the Scandinavian countries since they seemed to make up more than half of the Euro Top 10.
	        
	        Plus, we have top 10 lists dedicated to specific European countries (because they each had so many waterfalls on their own) such as the Top 10 Iceland Waterfalls List and the Top 10 Norway Waterfalls List among others.
	        
	        Nevertheless, you can imagine how difficult of a time we had just to keep a list of 10! Heck, it even made us re-evaluate the ratings of many of the waterfalls we’ve scored in the past.
	        
	        But in the end, after the rigorous filtering process, we ended up with this page as the end result. I’m sure this list will continue to change as we intend to visit more falls from this continent while making re-evaluations every so often.
	        
	        So without further ado, we present the Euro top 10 in reverse order…</em></strong></p>
